\begin{abstract}
As control engineering methods are applied to increasingly complex systems, data-driven approaches for system identification appear as a promising alternative to physics-based modeling.  Unfortunately, in many of these system the states cannot be measured which complicates the learning process and makes it difficult to quantify the epistemic and aleatory uncertainties of the unknown system. Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) methods provide ways for the joint estimation of the uncertain dynamics and latent states. Combining PMCMC methods with scenario theory enables the computation of optimal input trajectories for unknown systems with latent states. However, deriving guarantees for these input trajectories is computationally complex.

This thesis proposes a novel method that combines PMCMC sampling with maximum mean discrepancy ambiguity sets as an alternative to scenario theory. The goal is to optimize the trajectory of a system while satisfying chance-constraints where the underlying distribtion of the data is unknown due to the unknown system and latent states. The PMCMC samples are used to create an estimate of the distribution and the ambiguity set is constructed around that estimate to account for inaccuracy due to the limited data. By using ambiguity sets, it is possible to optimize the problem over a set of distributions that we can obtain through our samples rather than optimizing over a single unknown distribution. This allows us to find a robust solution for the problem and, in constrast to the scenario theory, also allows for the tuning of the robustness level in the optimization process. This is advantagous since it can lead to a reduction of the costs in exchange for a higher risk of the solution violating the constraints. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in numerical simulations.
