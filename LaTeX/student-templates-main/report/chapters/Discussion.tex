\chapter{Discussion} \label{Discussion}

%Discuss and explain your results. Show how they support your thesis (or, if they do not, give a convincing explanation). It is important to separate objective facts clearly from their discussion (which is bound to contain subjective opinion). If the reader does not understand your results, reconsider if you have managed to extract the core information and explain it in a straightforward way.
